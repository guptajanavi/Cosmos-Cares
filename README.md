An interactive space-themed website created for students to practice mindfulness by Natalie Sarabosing, Janavi Gupta and Avantika Gupta @ Carnegie Mellon University

# Inspiration
The inspiration for Cosmos Cares came from a desire to create a platform that promotes mindfulness and well-being among students, particularly by using a space-themed approach to make it engaging and calming. We wanted to provide a resource that not only helps students manage anxiety but also fosters a sense of wonder and curiosity about the cosmos.

# Features
The main page of our website is minimalistic and designed to allow you to explore features without being overwhelmed with information. Each star is hyperlinked to a different web-page that offers you the opportunity to practice mindfulness in different ways such as:\

1. **Mindfulness Journal:** Users can maintain a personal mindfulness journal where they can record their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, which they can then 'send to the moon'\

\
2. **Trivia:** The website provides interesting and educational space-related facts to stimulate curiosity and learning.

# How We Built It
We started off familiarising ourselves with Github to collaborate and Github Pages to generate and deploy the actual website. We mapped out the design of the website and started creating the actual content for the pages. We finally build Cosmos Cares using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript!

# Challenges We Ran Into
The primary challenge we ran into was that none of us had any experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github or Github Pages! We had a steep learning curve with firstly, coming up with all these ideas not knowing what was feasible or not, and then self-learning these new technologies to create a tangible website.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We're proud of having built a fully functional website with a space theme and multiple features for mindfulness and well-being, and successfully collaborating as a team to bring this project to life within the hackathon's timeframe despite a lack of experience.

# What We Learned
We gained a lot of new technical skills, in web development (HTML/CSS), UI/UX design, and backend development (JavaScript). We also gained project management skills i.e. learning how to manage time effectively, especially during a hackathon, and meeting project milestones.

# What's Next For Cosmos Cares
We hope to expand our website using JavaScript to enhance some features, like adding randomised affirmations, making the website more dynamic and with better animations/design features and make it suitable to be viewed on all types of screens. We also hope to add other methods of practicing mindfulness such as pomodoro timers and daily reminders to drink more water and go out more.
