An interactive space-themed website created for students to practice mindfulness.by Natalie Sarabosing, Janavi Gupta and Avantika Gupta @ Carnegie Mellon University

# Inspiration
The inspiration for Cosmos Cares came from a desire to create a platform that promotes mindfulness and well-being among students, particularly by using a space-themed approach to make it engaging and calming. We wanted to provide a resource that not only helps students manage anxiety but also fosters a sense of wonder and curiosity about the cosmos.
